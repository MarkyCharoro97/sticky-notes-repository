1. Preserving state in http applications

HTTP is a stateless protocol meaning each request to a server is independent and will not contain any knowledge of previous interactions.For preservation odf state across multiple request response cycles, web applications use s cookies, sessions and tokens.Cookies are storesd on the clieany side and can hold identifiers that link requests to server-side session data. Sessions, on the other hand, are stored on the server and are associated with a unique session ID that is usually passed to the client via cookies. For authentication, applications often use session-based authentication (server tracks user login state) or token-based authentication.Sessions, on the other hand, are stored on the server and are associated with a unique session ID that is usually passed to the client via cookies.

2. Django Database Migration With MariaDB

Django provides a migration system that manages database schema changes across different environments.When deploying Django to a server-based relational database like MariaDB, the first step is to install the MariaDB server and ensure the necessary Python client library (mysqlclient or mariadb-connector) is available. Then, in settings.py, update the DATABASES configuration to point to MariaDB, specifying the engine ('django.db.backends.mysql'), database name, user, password, host, and port. Once configured, you generate migration files using python manage.py makemigrations, which captures model changes, and then apply them to MariaDB with python manage.py migrate. Django will automatically translate the migration instructions into SQL statements compatible with MariaDB. On production servers, developers often use tools like environment variables or .env files to securely store database credentials. This migration process ensures that application models remain synchronized with the underlying relational database structure.
